# Getting Started


## Downloading QADE
The QADE plugin will be found on the discord. For this discord, you will need to ask for access to the right channel from one of the developers. 

When you have access to the discord channel, you have to go to the discord channel called “releases”. Here you will find all the releases from old to new. We will also provide you with information about the changes that have been made.

When you have selected the version you want you click on the form post and find the zip folder in the current post. This is the plugin that you will be using. The next step will be setting it up in your own project.

To make sure that the plugin is correctly set up in your project we can play the example level that we have created. This is placed in the plugin folder and you will find a folder called “Plugins/Qade Content/Maps”.

This is what you should see if this is not the case make sure to contact the developers.
